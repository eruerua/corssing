Dear Peter,
I remember you told me you were interested in teaching in China. Our school now is looking for a native-speaker to teach some courses to senior high students. If you come, you can choose three of the following four courses: Speaking, Writing,Britain Today and America Today, and teach 12 hours a week. The students who are going to take these courses have at least three years of English learning experiences. Besides teaching, you will also work as an advisor to our students’ English club or our school’s English newspaper.
Please let me know if you are interested and if you have any other questions. I’d be more than happy to help.
Best,
Li Hua
